## Overview
As a final project for the Embedded Systems course I took, we were required to use Rethink Robotics' Baxter for a pick and place application.

##Additional Components

The basic project was to pick up 6 objects and place them in a box on the side. Extra marks were given for the following:

* Picking up different shaped objects
* Picking up different coloured objects
* The speed at which Baxter could succesfully pick and place 6 items.
