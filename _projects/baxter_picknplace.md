## Overview
As a final project for the Embedded Systems course I took, we were required to use Rethink Robotics' Baxter for a pick and place application.

##Additional Components
* The basic project was to pick up 6 objects and place them in a box on the side. Extra marks were given for the following:
* Picking up different shaped objects
* Picking up different coloured objects
* The speed at which Baxter could succesfully pick and place 6 items.


####Interface characteristics

* The robot must be self-supporting on a simple wooden frame.
* The robot must be able to support a pen or pencil.
* The workspace is 10 cm by 10 cm.
* A suitable user interface is required. This must include an over-ride to completely stop
all robot motion.
* A serial interface to a PC may be used.
