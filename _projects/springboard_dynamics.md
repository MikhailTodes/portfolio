## Overview
The purpose of this project was to mathematically model and simulate the basic dynamics of an elastic impact between a diver and a spring board. The simulation was done in Mathematica using Euler-Legrange principles.

##Code
This was modeled using Wolfram's Mathematica software. The code can be found <a href="/portfolio/public/pdfs/springboard_code.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
