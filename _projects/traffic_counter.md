# Overview

As part of a computer vision course that I took during my masters the weekly homeworks were about understanding image processing algorithms and writing the code to implement them without using any preexisting computer vision libraries. 

# Software 

I chose to write my software in C++ which can all be found <a href="https://github.com/MikhailTodes/computer_vision_functions" target="_blank">here</a>.
The functions implemented were: 

* Identifying Connected Regions
* Morphological Operations
* Histogram Equalization and Lighting Correction
* Color Segmentation
* Canny Edge Detector
* Hough Transform
