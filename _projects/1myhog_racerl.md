# Abstract
MYHOG racer stands for Myo Controlled Hemispherical Omni-directional Gimbaled Racer. It uses just one hemisphere as a drive force. With the hemisphere constantly being spun and making contact with the ground, the gimbal's tilt allows drive in any direction. The Myo is an armband worn just below the elbow of the driver. It uses a combination of EMG, IMU, and accelerometer signals to achieve machine trained gesture recognition that allows the driver speed and direction control of the MYHOG. 

# Coming soon to a site near you!

[comment]: <> (Because the drive force is a hemisphere, the more it is tilted, the greater the radius between the point of contact with the ground and the central axis of rotation. As a result speed can be easily controlled.)
