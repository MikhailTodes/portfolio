## Overview
I developed the software to accompany Professor Kevin Lynchâ€™s text book entitled, Introduction to
Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control. This consisted of a library of functions designed to
aid robotic manipulation.

## Code
I wrote a version of the library in Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, and C. All this can be found <a href="https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Videos
The videos below were made using ROS and Rviz with a URDF for Universal Robotics' UR5 robotic arm. They animate two of the trajectory calculation functions developed in the library.
