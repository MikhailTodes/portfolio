## Overview
I developed a library of functions to accompany Professor Kevin Lynchâ€™s text book entitled, *Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control*. This software is now used as a teaching tool in his class.

## Code
The functions are available in:

* Python  
* MATLAB  
* Mathematica    
* C  

The functions can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics" target="_blank">here</a>.

Each function has a commented section above it explaining the inputs required for its use as well as an example of how it can be used and what the output will be. The repository also contains a <a href="https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics/blob/master/roblib.pdf" target="_blank">pdf document</a> that provides an overview of the available functions using MATLAB syntax. Functions are organized according to the chapter in which they are introduced in the book.

The primary purpose of the software is to be easy to read and educational, reinforcing the concepts in the book.

## Videos
The videos below were made using ROS and Rviz with a URDF for Universal Robotics' UR5 robotic arm. They animate two of the trajectory calculation functions developed in the library.
