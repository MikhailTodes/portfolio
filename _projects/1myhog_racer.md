# Abstract
MYHOG racer stands for Myo Controlled Hemispherical Omni-directional Gimballed Racer. It uses just one hemisphere as a drive force. With the hemisphere constantly being spun and making contact with the ground, the gimbal's tilt allows drive in any direction. Because the drive force is a hemisphere, the more it is tilted, the greater the radius between the point of contact with the ground and the central axis of rotation. As a result speed can be easily controlled. (More information can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispherical_omnidirectional_gimbaled_wheel" target="_blank">here</a>). The <a href="https://www.myo.com/" target="_blank">Myo</a> is an armband worn just below the elbow of the driver. It uses a combination of EMG, IMU, and accelerometer signals to achieve machine trained gesture recognition that allows the driver speed and direction control of the MYHOG.
