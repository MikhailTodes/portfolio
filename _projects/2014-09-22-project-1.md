## Overview
During my undergraduate, we were tasked with building a delta robot that could draw a circle, triangle, or square depending on the users preference. 

### Specifications
The following were the specifications we had to follow:

####Interface characteristics

* The robot must be self-supporting on a simple wooden frame.
* The robot must be able to support a pen or pencil.
* The workspace is 10 cm by 10 cm.
* A suitable user interface is required. This must include an over-ride to completely stop
all robot motion.
* A serial interface to a PC may be used.

####Functional characteristics

* The robot shall be able to draw a square, circle and equilateral triangle with user
specified dimensions.
* The robot capabilities may be demonstrated in any creative way for bonus marks.
