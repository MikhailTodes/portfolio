## What I am up to at the moment

I am currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University. This quarter I am taking courses in; Embedded Systems; Robotic Manipulation; Machine Dynamics; and Computational Geometry. 

## Education and Training

In January 2011, directly after matriculating from high school, I started studying at the University of Cape Town. I enrolled to do a BSc (Eng) in Mechatronics Engineering and I graduated in December 2014. During my studies, I attended a practical training course at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. There I learnt a few practical engineering trades including: to arc weld; to use a lathe machine; design automation with pneumatics; applied metrology; CNC machining; heat tempering and hardening; and Computer Aided Drafting.

In November 2013, I did a two month internship in the Bioelectronics and Neuroscience (BENS) Research Program at the University of Western Sydney. The projects that I was involved in were:

* Design and construction of a robotic system for stimulation and feedback control of the human peripheral sensory system (tactile sensing)
* Design and construction of hardware for a ping-pong playing robot

While I was there I also attended a seminar on the use of an Arduino for network communications.
