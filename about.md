# Brief Overview

I was born and raised in South Africa. I lived in Cape Town until September 2015 when I moved to Chicago. Coming from a place like Cape Town, I like to spend my free time outdoors. When I get the chance I enjoy surfing, hiking, mountain biking, and a new found fondness of snow boarding. I have a skippers license as well a scuba diving license. Other sports I enjoy playing and watching include: Football, Cricket, Rugby, and Cycling. I have participated and completed the Cape Town Cycle Race on seven occasions as well as numerous other races. I have also summited Mount Kilimanjaro.

# Education

**Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mechatronics** - **University of Cape Town**  
Enrolled Feb 2011 – Graduated Dec 2014.

**Master of Science in Robotics** - **Northwestern University**  
Enrolled Sep 2015 - (Expected) Graduated Dec 2016

# Experience

**Robotic Manipulation Software Development** - *(May 2016 - Sep 2016)*  
I developed the software to accompany Professor Kevin Lynch’s text book entitled, _Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control_. This consisted of a library of functions designed to aid robotic manipulation. I wrote a version of the library in Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, and C. This library can be found <a href="https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Internship** - *(Nov 2013 - Jan 2014)*  
In November 2013, I did a two month internship in the Bioelectronics and Neuroscience (BENS) Research Program at the University of Western Sydney. The projects that I was involved in were:

* Design and construction of a robotic system for stimulation and feedback control of the human peripheral sensory system (tactile sensing)
* Design and construction of hardware for a ping-pong playing robot

While I was there I also attended a seminar on the use of an Arduino for network communications.

**Practical Training** - *(Nov 2011)*  
During my Bachelors degree, I attended a practical training course at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. There I learnt a few practical engineering trades including: arc welding; lathe machining; design automation with pneumatics; applied metrology; CNC machining; heat tempering and hardening; and Computer Aided Drafting.

# What I am up to at the moment

I am currently still finishing my Masters degree. The courses I have taken include:

* Embedded Systems
* Robotic Manipulation
* Machine Dynamics
* Computational Geometry
