## What I am up to at the moment

I am currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University. The courses I have taken or am currently taking include:

* Embedded Systems
* Robotic Manipulation
* Machine Dynamics
* Computational Geometry
* Digital Image Analysis
* Feedback Systems
* Mechatronics 

## Education and Training

In January 2011, directly after matriculating from high school, I started studying at the University of Cape Town. I enrolled to do a BSc (Eng) in Mechatronics Engineering and I graduated in December 2014. During my studies, I attended a practical training course at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. There I learnt a few practical engineering trades including: to arc weld; to use a lathe machine; design automation with pneumatics; applied metrology; CNC machining; heat tempering and hardening; and Computer Aided Drafting.

In November 2013, I did a two month internship in the Bioelectronics and Neuroscience (BENS) Research Program at the University of Western Sydney. The projects that I was involved in were:

* Design and construction of a robotic system for stimulation and feedback control of the human peripheral sensory system (tactile sensing)
* Design and construction of hardware for a ping-pong playing robot

While I was there I also attended a seminar on the use of an Arduino for network communications.

Experience with Windows and Linux operating systems as well as ROS (Robot Operating System).


## Programming Languages 

* C
* C++
* Java
* Python
* MATLAB
* Mathematica

## Other Interests and Skills

Other than Engineering I like to spend my time outdoors. When I get the chance I enjoy surfing, hiking, mountain biking, and a new found fondness of snow boarding. I have a skippers license as well a scuba diving license. Other sports I enjoy to play and watch include: Football, Cricket, Rugby, and Cycling. I have participated and completed the Cape Town Cycle Race on seven occasions as well as numerous other races. I have also summited Mount Kilimanjaro.

## Languages

* English (Native language)
* Afrikaans
* Hebrew
