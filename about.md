# Brief Overview

I was born and raised in South Africa. I lived in Cape Town until September 2015 when I moved to Chicago. Coming from a place like Cape Town, I like to spend my free time outdoors. When I get the chance I enjoy surfing, hiking, mountain biking, and a new found fondness of snow boarding. I have a skippers license as well a scuba diving license. Other sports I enjoy playing and watching include: Football, Cricket, Rugby, and Cycling. I have participated and completed the Cape Town Cycle Race on seven occasions as well as numerous other races. I have also summited Mount Kilimanjaro.

# What I am up to at the moment

I am currently still finishing my Masters degree. The courses I have taken or am currently taking include:

* Embedded Systems
* Robotic Manipulation
* Machine Dynamics
* Computational Geometry
* Digital Image Analysis
* Feedback Systems
* Intro into Machine Learning
* Advanced Mechatronics
* Digital Control

The project I am working on at the moment is building a robotic rat's head. More about this can be seen on this <a href="http://mikhailtodes.github.io/portfolio/projects/robotic_rat/" target="_blank">here</a>

# Education and Training

In January 2011, directly after matriculating from high school, I started studying at the University of Cape Town. I enrolled to do a BSc (Eng) in Mechatronics Engineering and I graduated in December 2014. During my studies, I attended a practical training course at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. There I learnt a few practical engineering trades including: to arc weld; to use a lathe machine; design automation with pneumatics; applied metrology; CNC machining; heat tempering and hardening; and Computer Aided Drafting.

In November 2013, I did a two month internship in the Bioelectronics and Neuroscience (BENS) Research Program at the University of Western Sydney. The projects that I was involved in were:

* Design and construction of a robotic system for stimulation and feedback control of the human peripheral sensory system (tactile sensing)
* Design and construction of hardware for a ping-pong playing robot

While I was there I also attended a seminar on the use of an Arduino for network communications.

Experience with Windows and Linux operating systems as well as ROS (Robot Operating System).
